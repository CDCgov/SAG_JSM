## SAG's major activities

**SAG Professional Development**: Provides professional development opportunities including mentorship on scientific work or career development.

**SAG Training and Seminars**: By planning, co-sponsoring, presenting, and publicizing statistical lectures, short courses, monthly seminars and other activities, SAG supports the professional development of individuals and the statistical community within CDC, and enhances the use and application of quantitative methods. This is done in collaboration with CDC University and other partners.
